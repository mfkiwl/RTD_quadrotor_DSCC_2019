## Tracking Error (ERS) Computation
This folder computes the Error Reachable Set (ERS) for the quadrotor. Note that the term ERS was not used in our DSCC quadrotor RTD paper, but you can skim [this dissertation](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/162884) to understand how the parts fit together.

Since computing the tracking error table can take several hours, we've included precomputed ones for you in the `tracking_error_tables` folder.
