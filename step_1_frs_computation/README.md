## FRS Computation
This folder contains the scripts needed to compute an FRS for the quadrotor's simplified planning model (i.e., polynomial spline model) using CORA 2018.

Note that, in the broader context of [RTD](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/162884), we now call this step the planning reachable set (PRS) computation, which is separate from the [ERS computation](https://github.com/roahmlab/RTD_quadrotor_DSCC_2019/tree/main/step_2_tracking_error_computation) when representing RTD's reachable sets with zonotopes.
