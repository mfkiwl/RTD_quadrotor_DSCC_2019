## Simulation
This folder contains all the files needed to run simulations and comparisons between different trajectory planners. Extending beyond our [DSCC paper](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings/DSCC2019/59162/V003T19A010/1070634?casa_token=ZejWuBeKAngAAAAA:gKMET5yu5PNsDJ1Q69Nl41Rnn3VhAvqNqZPqCsS9aq0PfmOkSL9O7bbnIT260P6DbWxzKA), we have implemented planners based on [Mark Mueller's work ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7299672) and [Charles Richter's work](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-28872-7_37).

You can try out the different planners by initializing them and passing them to the `simulator`. See `run_quadrotor_simulation_comparison` for an example of how this works.
